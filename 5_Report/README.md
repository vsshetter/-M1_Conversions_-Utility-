# Introduction 

The number system is used for representing the information. In this project the user has the choice to give the input in any order(based on the choice) to get the required number system like decimal to binary and vice versa. The application of this is used to avoid hacking ,for encryption and avoids misuse of data. Most of all computer's architecture is in the form of number system [oct,hex].

# Requirements

## High Level Requirements
  # Features of my project
  * HL-1 System should take the input based on the choice given by the user
  * HL-2 System able to convert the input numbers into any other number system like decimal,hex,oct,binary.
  * HL-3 Output sould displayed without any errors

## Low Level Requirements
** HL-1_LL1  System need to verify whether the given input is in correct form or not.
 * HL-1_LL2  If input it is not in required system needs allow user to re enter the input.
       
** HL-2_LL1 System must know the all conversion techniques with the help of codes.
 * HL-2_LL2 System should consider time factor and it shoud give output in less time.

** HL-3_LL1 System must give the output in the defined way(like binary output must be with 0's and 1 forms).
 * HL-3_LL2 Output must be understood by the user.

## SWOT Analysis
# Strenghts
* Avalibility of resources
* Research
* Devolapment of system
* Applying skills

# Weaknesses
* Time
* Complexity of system
* Deadlines
* Does not include negative number

# Opportunities
* Optimization of current system
* Enhancement of system efficiency
* Can be used for encryption 

# Threats
* Different innovative methods will become threat 
* Obstacles are faced
