# Introduction 

The number system is used for representing the information. In this project the user gives input in the form of decimal number then the system converts it to binary,hexa,octal,bcd,excess-3,gray. The application of this is used to avoid hacking ,for encryption and avoids misuse of data. Most of all computer's architecture is in the form of number system [oct,hex].

# Requirements

## High Level Requirements
  # Features of my project
  * HL-1 System should take the decimal input and store it
  * HL-2 System able to convert the input numbers into any other number system like decimal,hex,oct,bcd
  * HL-3 Output sould displayed without any errors



## Low Level Requirements
** HL-1_LL1  System need to verify whether the given input is in decimal form or not.
 * HL-1_LL2  If input it is not in decimal system allow user to re enter the input.
       
** HL-2_LL1 System must know the all conversion techniques with the help of codes.
 * HL-2_LL2 System should consider time factor and it shoud give output in less time.

** HL-3_LL1 System must give the output in the defined way(like binary output must be with 0's and 1 forms).
 * HL-3_LL2 Output must be unstood by the user.
